##Change Notes:

###Version 1.1

- Removed the /photography section. Code still exists, but I wasn't using it.
- Updated color scheme to leverage Flat UI colors. (http://flatuicolors.com/)
- Updated SASS support in the stylesheets to make color changing easier
- Tweaked public profiles a bit (the sidebar)
- Removed "Your pages" from the supporter nav, since — honestly — almost no one will have any

###Version 1.0

- Lots of changes from the basic Aware theme. (http://aware-theme.nationbuilder.com)
- Added recent blog posts to the homepage.
- Added [Google+ support](http://www.ianpatrickhines.com/google_plus_support).
- Added the /photography section, which allows me to publish blog posts that are — basically — photo posts.
